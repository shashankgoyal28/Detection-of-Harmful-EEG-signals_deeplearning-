# Detection-of-Harmful-EEG-signals_deeplearning-
Doctors rely on various tools, including electroencephalography (EEG), to monitor brain activity in critically ill patients and detect seizures. However, current EEG analysis is manually done by neurologists, which is time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors and inconsistencies.

The Sunstella Foundation, established in 2021 to support minority graduate students in technology, is hosting a competition to automate EEG analysis, in partnership with Persyst, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and the Clinical Data Animation Center (CDAC). The goal is to help doctors and researchers improve the detection and treatment of seizures and brain activity that can cause brain damage.

The competition focuses on identifying six EEG patterns: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), and "other." EEG segments used in the competition have been annotated by experts, with varying levels of agreement. "Idealized" patterns have high agreement among experts, "proto patterns" have split opinions between "other" and another label, and "edge cases" are divided between two of the five named patterns. The algorithms developed could also aid in drug development for seizure treatment and prevention.
